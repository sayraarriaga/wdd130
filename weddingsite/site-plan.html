      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>The main purpose of the Nazario & Sayra wedding website is to help their beloved ones to feel close to the couple and involved in this special day. To do this I want to give to the family and friends the opportunity to know a little about the story of the couple.
        I would like to help them to be prepared to enjoy this event, by showing them the itinerary.
        This site should show the date, time, and dress code of every activity.

           <p>Our history</p>

        <p>Whe met on february 2018</p> 
        <p>Naz had just moved to our ward in the church. We were in choir practice and he came to me to ask me if I was going to the institute class. 
          Then he sat next to me in the class, we talk a lot that night.</p>
         
          <p>Our first Date</p>
        <p>Naz, invite me to a violin concert. He told me the place and time, and we set to meet there. 
          I get to the theatre right on time, but everyone was leaving the place, he was there with a big nervous smile, he had made a mistake about the time, the concert was over! We laugh a lot, we went for some milkshakes and for a walk, then I knew that someone as organized as I, it may be good to have someone as spontaneous and fun as him.</p>
