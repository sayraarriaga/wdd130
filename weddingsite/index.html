                     We were in choir practice and he came to me to ask me if I was going to the institute class.
                      Then he sat next to me in the class, we talk a lot that night. </p>

                <p class="first-date-paragraph">Naz, invite me to a violin concert. 
                    He told me the place and time, and we set to meet there. 
                    I get to the theatre right on time, but everyone was leaving the place,
                     he was there with a big nervous smile, he had made a mistake about the time, 
                     the concert was over! We laugh a lot, we went for some milkshakes and for a walk,
                      then I knew that someone as organized as I, it may be good to have someone as spontaneous
                       and fun as him.
