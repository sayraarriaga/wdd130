    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <h3>Purpose</h3>
    <p>The main purpose of my white water rafting website is to build revenue. 
        To do this I want to give the customers the opportunity to know what we offer as a vacation company.
         I would like to help potential clients which want to try rifting for the first time to know what to expect 
         and to find answers to their doubts, to know our safety measures and what kind of activities can they live in white water rifting. 
         And for those with experience in rifting, I would like to show why our company has what they are looking for to have a safe and adventure time. 
         This site should show all the activities that our company offers retreats, vacations, scouting activities, group trips, and solo adventures.</p>

You should have at least 2 colors but do not have to fill in all 4 if you do not need them.  -->
